I am 48 years old and what a life! Born in Quebec, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the [University of Sherbrooke](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/) and an MBA from [Keller University Graduate School of Management](https://www.keller.edu/) in the United States. I lived in the United States during 12 years and worked across several industries for large, medium and small businesses. More information about my career is available on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancybilodeau/).

In 2007, living under the pressures and demands of working in the corporate world, I developed sleep and anxiety issues that affected my work performance and quality of life. At that time, I embarked on the global health research path and discovered the benefits of yoga, meditation and breathing techniques. The techniques were so effective in helping me with my sleep and anxiety issues, that I became passionate about helping others with these issues. I became a yoga teacher in 2009 and started teaching advanced breathing techniques in 2011.

I continued working in the corporate world through 2012. Finding myself often drained and sick through living a lifestyle that emphasizes consumption and performance, I was forced to take a break to find out why I was doing so bad. Finding back all my energy and joy for life after following the [Karyn Calabrese](https://karynraw.com/) detox program, I reoriented myself to a life of service for the well-being of others.

In 2013, I founded Om Prana Holistic Center Inc., located on St-Joseph Street in Quebec City. The center offered a vegan raw food restaurant with a yoga and meditation studio, a health food corner store and several cooking classes, and health and personal development programs. During my 3-year tenure, I offered the detox program to more than 200 people. Testimonies abound from people who regained their energy, found back joy of living, decreased the progression of degenerative diseases, increased the clarity of their mind and more. At the same time, I was able to deepen my knowledge by completing the Holistic Coach training at [The Hippocrates Health Institute](https://hippocratesinst.org/), I also attend the [Sanoviv Medical Institute](http://www.sanoviv.com/) and obtained a nutrition advisor certificate and I also completed my Reiki level 1 and 2 all the while continuing to teach and expand my knowledge of yoga, meditation and breaths with The Art of Living, Deepak Chopra and Kripalu.

In 2016, I decided to move away from restauration and made a comeback in the corporate environment to apply all my new acquired knowledge of the human being in the workplace. The experience was most rewarding. The well-being of individuals is reflected quickly on a team’s performance. Over the course of the following 2 years, it became clear to me that I wanted to focus on the wellbeing of people and businesses performance.

> I fervently believe that by helping people regain the joy of living by freeing themselves from their suffering and reconnecting with their essence, we can contribute to the overall well-being of all. We are all here to fulfill ourselves, serve and be happy. Blockages or imbalances are only guides to help us find our way.

In December 2018 I obtained my [PEACE Certification](http://stephanedrouet.com/), than my Cosmonergy Certification in March 2019.

Early in 2020, I became Certified Coach with the [SICPNL](https://sicpnl.org).

I am looking forward meeting you and support you on your journey.
