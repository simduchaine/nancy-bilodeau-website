Nancy is 47 years old and what a life! Born in Quebec, she holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the [University of Sherbrooke](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/) and an MBA from [Keller University Graduate School of Management](https://www.keller.edu/) in the United States. She lived in the United States during 12 years and has worked across several industries for large, medium and small businesses. More information about her career is available on her [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancybilodeau/).

Nancy embarked on the global health research path in 2007. First, with significant sleep and anxiety issues, Nancy discovered the benefits of yoga, meditation and breathing techniques. Nancy became a yoga teacher in 2009 and started with advanced breathing techniques in 2011.

It is in 2012 that Nancy, well adapted to our society of consumption and performance, and then Project Manager at Sears Holdings Corporation in the United States, is forced to take a break to find out why she was lacking so much energy. Finding back all her energy and joy for life following [Karyn Calabrese](https://karynraw.com/) detox program, she decided to reorient herself to serve for the well-being of all.

In 2013, Nancy founded Om Prana Holistic Center Inc., located on St-Joseph Street in Quebec City. The center offered a vegan raw food restaurant with a yoga and meditation studio, a health food corner store and several cooking classes, health and personal development programs. During her three years tenure, she offered the detox program to more than 200 people. Testimonies abound from people who regained their energy, found back joy of living, decreased the progression of degenerative diseases, increased the clarity of their mind and more. At the same time, Nancy was able to deepen her knowledge by completing the Holistic Coach training at [The Hippocrates Health Institute](https://hippocratesinst.org/), she also attend the [Sanoviv Medical Institute](http://www.sanoviv.com/) and obtained a nutrition advisor certificate and she also competed her Reiki level 1 and 2 all the while continuing to teach and expand her knowledge of yoga, meditation and breaths with The Art of Living, Deepak Chopra and Kripalu.

In 2016, Nancy decided to move away from restauration and made a comeback in the corporate environment to apply all her new acquired knowledge of the human being in the workplace. The experience was most rewarding. The well-being of individuals is reflected quickly on a team’s performance. Over the course of the following 2 years, it became clear to Nancy that she wanted to focus on the well being of people and businesses.

> I fervently believe that by helping people regain the joy of living by freeing themselves from their suffering and reconnecting with their essence, we can contribute to the overall well-being of all. We are all here to fulfill ourselves, serve and be happy. Blockages or imbalances are only guides to help us find our way.

In December 2018 she obtained her [PEACE Certification](http://stephanedrouet.com/), than her Cosmonergy Certification in March 2019.

Nancy is ready to welcome you and support on your own journey!
