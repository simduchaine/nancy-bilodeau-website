The PEACE method (Empathic Process of Physical and Emotional Abandonment) is a new approach developed and deployed since 2017 by the famous author, researcher [Stéphane Drouet](http://stephanedrouet.com/).

The method allows amongst other to address addictions, relationship problems, bereavements, fears, blockages of all kinds, and guilt.

The PEACE method is the result of Stéphane's eleven years of therapeutic practice, rare and un precedent researches, work on himself and his clients, and a passion for human being. The method makes the link between very different approaches and studies, links not yet created by the scientific field as they work mostly isolated. PEACE joins neuroscience, heart coherence and quantum physics, among other things, to offer a technique for liberating memories that causes our suffering, our energy drains and limitations.

Nancy is amongst the first group of therapists trained in Quebec City in December 2018.

The work in PEACE is based on the body and its sensations. It aims at unfreezing fascias and fluidizing memories in order to leave room for new possibilities. To understand the why of the why is no longer necessary; releasing energy blocked in the body is however essential and at the basis of the method’s efficiency.
