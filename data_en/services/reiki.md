Reiki is an art of spiritual healing that appeared in Japan at the end of the 18th century through the placing the hands gently on or over the body. The word Reiki comes from the Japanese word (Rei) which means "Universal Life" and (Ki) which means "Energy". Reiki is not affiliated with any religion.

Reiki is the vital energy that flows through all living things. When it is strong and free, the body and mind are placed in a positive state of health. When energy becomes weak or blocked, it can lead to symptoms of physical or emotional imbalance.

A Reiki treatment can help relieve tensions and stress and can help the body create an environment that is conducive to healing at all levels: physical, mental and emotional. Some hospitals now recognize the power of hands imposition in the healing process and support this technique.

Nancy practices Reiki as taught by **Mikao Usui**.

A session begins with an assessment of your needs and your current condition. The treatment is then oriented according to your needs, lying on a massage table while remaining dressed.

Nancy often uses Reiki to complement the other available treatments.
