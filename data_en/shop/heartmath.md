Since 1991, HMI has been developing tools to help us measure and improve our coherence in order to better manage our stress and respond to life's events.

- Refuel energy
- Regularize your emotions
- Calm his mind

**Take control of your emotions**

It is easy today to be completely overwhelmed, anxious and scattered. The Inner Balance tool leads us, among other things, to increase our resilience through breathing while shifting our attention to positive and regenerative emotions.

**The breakthrough of Coherence**

Consistency is a state of harmony between our heart, our mind and the functions of our autonomic nervous system. This harmony offers mental, emotional and even physical benefits. You can imagine consistency as a perfect state of calm while being focused, energized and ready to take action.

The benefits generally observed after two weeks of practice are:

- Feeling of increased inner peace
- Improved sleep
- Reduced tensions in relations
- Fewer worries
- More alert
- Better concentration
- Better decision-making
- More positive attitude
- Increased calm
