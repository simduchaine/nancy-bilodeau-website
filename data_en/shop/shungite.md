Shungite is often called "the stone of life" because of its healing, anti-oxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antitoxic properties. It is a rare and powerful stone whose age is estimated at 2 billion years. It is found only in Russia in the region of Karelia. It is composed of Carbon 60 (Fullerene), from which it draws all its strength. In 1991, Science magazine named the fullerene - molecule of the year. In Russia, Shungite is used in some hospitals where shorter healing times are observed.

Shungiteâ€™s greatest strength is its ability to restore our torsion field\* provide definition below). According to researcher Vlail Kaznatcheev, rotations to the right favor life while a torsion field to the left is harmful to our cells. Pulsed wave emissions like WIFI and DECT generate a left torsion field. Wearing Shungite or keeping it near our body greatly helps us maintain our energy and protects us from torsion field inversion. Many people suffering for environmental sensitivity have praised the benefits of Shungite.
