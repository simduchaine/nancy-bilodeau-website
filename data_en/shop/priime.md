The power of essential oils is more and more recognized and appreciated. They can energize, calm, repair and so much more.

I use the following blends regularly:

**To calm myself**

Lavender combined with the soothing oils of neroli, valerian and damask rose helps relieve agitation, anxiety and promotes peace and tranquility.

**To sooth muscle pain**

Peppermint, white camphor, birch and wintergreen are refreshing essences that soothe sore muscles. Black peppermint oil stimulates blood circulation, while the other key ingredients penetrate the muscle to relieve deep muscle pain.

**To free myself from stress and tensions**

Incense mixed with frankincense, scented helichrysum, soothing Roman chamomile and spearmint helps relieve tension, reduce stress and uplift the mood.

**To clean and disinfect**

Cinnamon, cloves, tea tree oil and other natural purifying extracts help disinfect the house leaving a pleasant scent of cleanliness. This mixture also helps to disinfect small wounds.

**As a base for my oils**

Use fractionated coconut oil as a base for your essential oil blends oils, or use on its own for massage. Fractionated coconut oil is a food grade carrier oil and is very easily absorbed by the skin, hair and digestive system, making it an ideal moisturizer,, massage oil and dietary aid. I often combine it with the blends mentioned above to facilitate their application and make the most of their healing benefits.
