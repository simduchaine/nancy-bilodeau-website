Holistic Coaching is here to help you feel better, be healthier and happier

> In epistemology or in the human sciences, relating to the doctrine which brings back the knowledge of the particular, of the individual to that of the whole, of the whole in which it is inscribed. (Petit Larousse). Holistic, which is interested in its object as a whole. Relates to Holism. Holism: the tendency in nature to constitute sets that are greater than the sum of their parts, through creative evolution (Wikipedia)

My holistic coaching approach aims to look at all the dimensions of a person to help them find balance, harmony, optimal well-being and achieve their goals.

We are much more than our physical body. A perfectly healthy physical body does not guarantee a well-balanced and happy person. Just as a sick physical body can be inhabited by a fully realized and happy person!

When looking for well being, here are the key dimensions to explore:

* Physical body health
* Emotional harmony
* Energy flow
* Intellect fluidity
* Soul radiance
* Limiting memories release
* Mind hyperactivity
* Breathing quality
* Lifestyle habits
* Environment quality

My approach is very effective for people who:

* are exhausted
* lack joy of living
* no longer have energy and do not know what to do to find it
* suffer from depression, anxiety, isolation and uncontrolled fears
* want to realize a dream or project but can not seem to find their way
* want to learn how to better manage their stress
* suffer from chronic pain or inflammation and wish to explore alternative methods
* wish to take control of their health but are lost with all the available approaches
* want to lose weight but can not do it despite several diets and multiple trials
* are struggling with addictions and destructive behaviors
* have difficult relationships with others and / or their significant other
