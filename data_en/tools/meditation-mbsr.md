Meditation is very effective for people with a restless mind and a tendency toward rumination, stress and anxiety. Some studies even confirm the beneficial effects in terms of pain reduction, decrease in cortisol and increase in happy hormones. I have 2,500 hours of meditation and master different techniques to help you find the right one for you.
