title: Breathing Technique
---

There are hundreds of breathing techniques from yoga schools, meditation teaching, and more recently heart variability studies. I am getting the best results with Heart Coherence pratices. However, I regularly use other techniques depending on the needs of the individual or groups I am working with. Alternate nostril breathing and the Power Breath are especially appreciated in corporate setting.
