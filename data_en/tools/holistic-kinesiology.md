Holistic kinesiology is a supportive tool that provides access to what is unconscious through muscle resistance testing. I use this approach primarily in my [Cosmonergy](/en/services/cosmonergy/) care to guide me through the application of accuboost. This form of energy medicine has been designed by Jacques TÃ©treault acupuncturist. It allows us to work on a physical, emotional, mental and spiritual level.
