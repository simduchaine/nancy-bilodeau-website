As my approach is holistic, I consider the individual as a whole: body, mind, heart, emotion, energy, memory, intellect and soul. I have different tools to support you with your needs and in your quest. My approach goes far beyond the immediate symptoms such as fatigue and discomfort. I aim at identifying and solving the real causes for them to restore balance and well-being in your life.

During your first meeting, we take the time to understand your current situation and your goals. From this information, I am able to offer you an approach that combines the appropriate tools to help you reach your health and happiness goals.

Here are some of the tools I have to support you on your journey.
